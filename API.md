# sFunc API
Here, you'll found the API of sFunc.

### Usage
For the usage, in the version 0.1.0 I'll change the wrap func into Object Literal. Like this.: `sFunc.method(argument);`, which you can look up at the API below.

### Cookie & Local Storage
I didn't quite understand the usage of local storage somehow. But I know that cookie & local storage was a different thing.. so I'll mix this two together in place. Just in case until I've learned the definition of localStorage, I'll only add cookie and will remove local storage if it's totally a same thing.
